# Lyric Predictor

This project is a lyric predictor that can discriminate between lyrics from two different artists based on Natural Language Processing (NLP). The predictor is designed to help music enthusiasts distinguish between lyrics written by different artists.

# Overview

The lyric predictor uses NLP to analyze lyrics written by two different artists and trains a machine learning model to distinguish between them. The model can then be used to predict which artist is more likely to have written a particular set of lyrics.

The project is written in Python and utilizes libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy for data analysis and machine learning. The lyrics are scraped from lyrics.com via Beautiful Soup
